- 👋 Hi, I’m @AliMcG
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code and what can be done with this skill.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, Typescript, React.js, Node.js/Express.js, Python, HTML and CSS
- 💞️ I’m looking to develop my skills on the front-end with React.js and CSS, expand my knowledge of API CRUD routes with Node.js/Express.js and Django on the back end, and continuing to work with SQL and non-SQL databases.
- 📫 You can find me on LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/alistair-mcgill-30a404106/
- 📫 I also have a portfolio - https://ali-mcgill-my-portfolio.netlify.app/
